This seminar paper is a project we had to do in college for the course Modeling and Simulation on a topic of your choice. 

My topic was an energy-saving smart house. 

Using calculations and a video simulation in SketchUp I showed how, by using certain devices, 
we can use renewable energy sources smarted and how we can reduce their usage.
